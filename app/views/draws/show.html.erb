            <p>You've traded Secret Santa presents before, but you probably only got crumbly chocolates or some plastic crap. Blog Secret Santa is way amazinger. It's a chance for content strategists from all around the world to gift each other blog posts. And it's all anonymous, so you can say what you really think!</p>

            <p>Let's face it, writing for your same old blog day in, day out is a grind. Sure, you enjoy writing and all, but wouldn't it be great to write something else for a change, and let a specially selected, unknown individual from the internet look after your blog? Wouldn't that be like the best, funnest Christmas ever?</p>

            <p>Blog Secret Santa uses the bestness of Christmas to save you from the grindness of blogging. (That's our elevator pitch, even though there aren't many elevators in the North Pole.)</p>
