<p>
	Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,
</p>
<p>
	Thanks for joining Blog Secret Santa! This Christmas content strategists all over the world are going to gift each other blog posts,and it's great that you're a part of it.
</p>
<p>
	I'll be tweeting updates all along, so follow <%= link_to "@blogsecretsanta", "http://twitter.com/blogsecretsanta", target: "_blank" %> to stay in touch.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>What happens next?</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Registrations will be open until December 4th. Spread the word (and the Christmas cheer) before then!
</p>
<p>
	Once registrations close, you'll get an email letting you know whose blog you're gifting a post to (but shh, it's a secret). That gives everyone 3 weeks to write their gift.
</p>
<p>
	On Christmas morning (GMT) I'll send you your gift post to publish. Tweet me once it's up and I'll let everyone know.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks again for joining in. You'll hear from me again on December 4th.
</p>
<p>
	Bye for now,
</p>
<p>
	Blog Secret Santa.
