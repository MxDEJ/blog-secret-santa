Hi everyone,

Now that Christmas is little more than a distant, fading memory, let me say a great big THANK YOU to all of you for playing Blog Secret Santa. The Elves and I had a great time, and it's fair to say that there are some pretty great gift posts out there now. It feels good to give!

So, now what? First of all: We'll be back for Christmas 2014. We have a sackful of ideas to make it bigger and better next time. If you want to suggest something or help out, drop me an email or a tweet.

Registrations will be open all year on secretsanta.csworkflow.com, so spread the word. We'll get loud about it again at the end of the year. I hope you'll all be back for another round.

Since you played in 2013, I've kept you on my list of Good Children. (You can see everyone here: http://secretsanta.csworkflow.com/users). This doesn't mean that you're 100% committed to playing in 2014; you can change your availability, or remove yourself entirely, by editing your profile.

Have you read all the gift posts yet?

I have a list of gift posts at secretsanta.csworkflow.com/draws/2013/gifts. Right now there are 36 gifts there, which means some are still missing.

If you've published a gift that isn't on this list, log in and "update your gift". Paste in the post's URL and it will automatically appear on the blog roll.

Spotted a missing post? Let me know.

Still waiting for your gift post?

4 of you missed out on receiving anything, which makes Santa sad. Hold on, though - we have elves working on the situation right now.

Thanks again everybody, and have a great year. You'll hear from me again when we're ready for Christmas 2014. I can't wait!

Love,

Santa.
