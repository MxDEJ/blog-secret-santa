Hi <%= @user.name %>

Thanks for joining Blog Secret Santa! This Christmas content strategists all over the world are going to gift each other blog posts, and it's great that you're a part of it.

I'll be tweeting updates all along, so follow http://twitter.com/blogsecretsanta to stay in touch.

What happens next?

Registrations will be open until December 4th. Spread the word (and the Christmas cheer) before then!

Once registrations close, you'll get an email letting you know whose blog you're gifting a post to (but shh, it's a secret). That gives everyone 3 weeks to write their gift.

On Christmas morning (GMT) I'll send you your gift post to publish. Tweet me once it's up and I'll let everyone know.

Thanks again for joining in. You'll hear from me again on December 4th.

Bye for now,

Blog Secret Santa.
