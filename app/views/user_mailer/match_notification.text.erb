Hi <%= @giver.name %>

Christmas is only 3 weeks away, so I've just made the Blog Secret Santa draw.

You'll be secretly gifting a blog post to <%= @receiver.name %> (<%= @receiver.url %>). 'Tis the season to start writing!

When you're ready to, log into Blog Secret Santa (<%= root_url %>) and submit your blog post. Submissions close on Christmas Eve, so be sure to finish your Christmas blogging before then.

I'll gift wrap your post and pass it on to <%= @receiver.name %> on Christmas Day.

Someone else has drawn your name. It could be anyone on my list of good children (<%= users_url %>). You'll receive your anonymous gift post on Christmas Day too.

Merry Christmas, and happy blogging!
