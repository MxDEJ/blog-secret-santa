Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Thanks for joining Blog Secret Santa! This Christmas bloggers all over the world are going to gift each other blog posts, and it's great that you're a part of it.

I'll be tweeting updates all along, so follow @blogsecretsanta (http://twitter.com/blogsecretsanta) to stay in touch.

What happens next?

Registrations will be open until December 4th. Spread the word (and the Christmas cheer) before then!

Once registrations close, you'll get an email letting you know whose blog you're gifting a post to (but shh, it's a secret). That gives everyone 3 weeks to write their gift.

On Christmas morning (GMT) I'll send you your gift post to publish. We'll put up a list of posts as they appear online, so you can see all the gifts and goodness.

Thanks again for joining in. You'll hear from me again on December 4th.

Merry Christmas,
Blog Secret Santa.
