Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Can you believe it's only one week till Christmas? In 7 days I'm going to deliver your brand new blog post, lovingly written by a wonderful stranger, straight to your inbox.

The first two weeks of writing time have been great fun. I've loved reading the tweets from people as they get into the giving, blogging spirit of things.

There are only 7 days left to get your Blog Secret Santa post written and submitted to secretsanta.csworkflow.com. Just in case you didn't have enough to do this week.

### Haven't started yet?
Have a read of my tips and topic ideas ( http://secretsanta.csworkflow.com/tips ) to nudge you along.

### Already written your post?
If you've already logged in and saved your post, thanks!

There's still time to log back in and add that one last piece of inspiration that hit you overnight. You can edit your post as much as you want before I deliver it.

### Have a Merry Christmas!
Everyone, seriously, have a great Christmas. You're 50 of the finest humans on the planet.

Love,

Santa.
