	It's writing time! Writing a post for a blog you've never written for (or maybe even seen) before isn't always easy, though, so here are a few things that might help.
</p>
<h2>
	Get to know the person you're writing for
</h2>
<p>
	Have a dig into the life and times of your gift recipient. The more you know about them, the easier it will be to write something that they'll love. You'll already have a link to their blog URL, so you're part-way there. Keep digging, though. Are they on Twitter? LinkedIn? Lanyrd? Google them and see what comes up. The age of privacy is OVER!
</p>
<h3>
	On a related note, make sure your writer can find your blog
</h3>
<p>
	If you haven't already told me your blog's URL , you can add it to your profile. Once you're logged into the Secret Santa site, access your profile through your picture in the top right-hand corner.
</p>
<p>
	Once you've done that, your writer will have an easy way of seeing what they're adding to.
</p>
<h2>
	Only got half a idea so far? Save work to come back to
</h2>
<p>
	The way you submit your post to me is really simple. When you click the "Work on your content gift" you'll come straight to this site, where you can start writing.
</p>
<p>
	You can log in as many times as you like, so if you want to save and come back, that's fine by me. Whatever you have saved when midnight rolls around on Christmas Eve (GMT) is what I'll wrap up and send on as your gift.
</p>
<h2>
	Not sure what to write about?
</h2>
<p>
	If you're struggling for inspiration, here are a few questions to get you started:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		What's the most useful thing you learned this year?
	</li>
	<li>
		Who's your <%= Time.now.strftime("%Y") %> Person Of The Year? Why? What prize would you give them?
	</li>
	<li>
		 <span style="font-size: 16.3636360168457px; line-height: 1.42857143;">What's one thing that would make next year the Best Year Ever? If you could do or learn anything by this time next year, what would it be?</span><br />
	</li>
	<li>
		 <span style="font-size: 16.3636360168457px; line-height: 1.42857143;">If you met your gift recipient in real life, what's the first thing you'd say to them?</span><br />
	</li>
	<li>
		What about responding to a post your recipient wrote this year? Has reading their blog get you thinking about something new?
	</li>
	<li>
		Got any new year's resolutions? Why not?
	</li>
	<li>
		Or you could just talk about me. How awesome is Blog Secret Santa? Yeah!
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Or take advantage of your anonymity
</h3>
<p>
	Since your readers aren't going to know who wrote your blog post, maybe this is your chance to say something wild, or even make a confession.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		What's something you know you should really stop doing?
	</li>
	<li>
		What's the one thing that everyone else seems to understand but you just don't get?
	</li>
	<li>
		What's the stupidest idea you heard all year?
	</li>
	<li>
		What's the stupidest idea you had all year?
	</li>
</ul>
