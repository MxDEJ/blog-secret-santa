	You've traded Secret Santa presents before, but you probably only got crumbly chocolates or some plastic crap. Blog Secret Santa is way amazinger. It's a chance for bloggers from all around the world to gift each other blog posts. And it's all anonymous, so you can say what you really think!
</p>
<p>
	Let's face it, writing for your same old blog day in, day out is a grind. Sure, it's fun all, but wouldn't it be great to write something else for a change, and let a specially selected, unknown individual from the internet look after your blog? Wouldn't that be like the best, funnest Christmas ever?
</p>
<p>
	Blog Secret Santa uses the bestness of Christmas to save you from the grindness of blogging. (That's our elevator pitch, even though there aren't many elevators in the North Pole.)
